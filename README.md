# Fake_News_Defense
 A Web Infrastructure for Certifying Multimedia News Content for Fake News Defense

# Abstract
In dealing with altered multimedia newsworthy content, also referred to as fake news,
we present a ready-to-deploy scheme based on existing public key infrastructure (PKI),
to provide an endorsement and integrity check platform for newsworthy multimedia content.  

# How it Works
There are two components, server side, and client side.  The server side relies
on the news organizations creation of a side car file (XMP).  The client side is
a simple Javascript browser extension written for Mozilla's Firefox browser.
