# A Web Infrastructure for Certifying Multimedia News Content for Fake News Defense
This project was motivated by the difficulty associated with identifying fake news,
particularly the misleading visual multimedia content that deludes users on social
networks.  

# Abstract
In dealing with altered multimedia newsworthy content, also referred to as fake
news, we present a ready-to-deploy scheme based on existing public key
infrastructure (PKI), to provide an endorsement and integrity check platform for
newsworthy multimedia content.  

# How it Works
There are two components, server side, and client side.  The server side relies
on the news organizations creation of a side car file (XMP) for each particular
image associated with this file.  The client side is responsible for reading The
side car file (XMP) and verifying its endorsement and authenticity using
a simple Javascript browser extension written for Mozilla's Firefox web browser.
